This plugin will replicate the realtime sample recording and playback functionality with exact parameter mappings, providing advanced audio manipulation features for digital audio workstations.\n\n## Objectives\n- Deliver a production-ready audio plugin that captures the essence of Elektron's legendary RAM machines\n- Implement exact ELEKTRON appendix A-15 specifications for RAM RECORD (R1-R4) and RAM PLAY (P1-P4) machines\n- Provide musicians and producers with powerful, creative sampling tools with authentic hardware behavior\n- Ensure low-latency, high-performance operation in professional DAW environments\n- Maintain compatibility across Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms\n\n## Scope\n### In Scope\n- **Exact emulation of RAM RECORD machines (R1-R4)** with all appendix A-15 parameters:\n  - MLEV (Main Level): Sets level of internal sound from Main outputs (0-127)\n  - MBAL (Main Balance): Monophonic recording balance from Main outputs (0-127)\n  - ILEV (Input Level): Sets level from external inputs (0-127)\n  - IBAL (Input Balance): Monophonic recording balance from external inputs (0-127)\n  - CUE1: Pre-listening level for Main/external inputs (0-127)\n  - CUE2: Pre-listening level for recording trigger (0-127)\n  - LEN (Length): Recording duration (0-127, 127 = 2 bars, each step = 1/64 step)\n  - RATE: Recording quality control (0-127, lower values = lower quality, saves DSP memory)\n\n- **Exact emulation of RAM PLAY machines (P1-P4)** functioning exactly like ROM machines 25-48:\n  - Full ROM machine parameter set: Start, End, Length, Hold, Sample Rate, Decay, Trigger, Repeats\n  - All track effects: Amplitude Modulation, 1-Band EQ, Resonant Filter, Sample Rate Reduction, Distortion\n  - Complete modulation targets for all parameters\n  - LFO synchronization and parameter lock support\n\n- **RAM Machine Tutorial Workflow**: Implement the complete workflow from ELEKTRON appendix A-15:\n  - Recording from Main outputs with MLEV=0, ILEV=-64\n  - LEN=64 and RATE=127 for 1-bar maximum quality capture\n  - Playback with parameter-locked STRT manipulation\n  - Real-time recording and playback with CUE monitoring\n\n- High-quality time-stretching with multiple algorithms\n- Comprehensive filter system with drive and modulation\n- Effects chains (delay, reverb, distortion, etc.)\n- LFO and parameter modulation system\n- Intuitive GUI with Elektron-inspired aesthetic\n- Preset management with factory and user presets\n- VST3 and CLAP format support\n- MIDI note triggering and parameter automation\n\n### Out of Scope\n- Hardware integration or physical modeling\n- Multi-machine chaining (focus on single machine emulation)\n- Live recording workflow (external recording workflow assumed)\n- Third-party plugin hosting\n- Real-time collaboration features\n\n## Deliverables\n- Cross-platform VST3/CLAP plugin binaries\n- Factory preset bank showcasing RAM machine capabilities\n- User manual and documentation with appendix A-15 parameter reference\n- Demo project files\n- Source code repository\n\n## Success Criteria\n- Plugin passes all major DAW compatibility tests\n- Audio quality matches or exceeds Elektron hardware standards\n- CPU usage remains under 5% for single instance on modern hardware\n- Zero crashes or stability issues in extended testing\n- Positive user feedback from beta testers\n- Commercial viability for plugin marketplace distribution\n- **100% parameter accuracy with ELEKTRON appendix A-15 specifications**","status":"open","priority":0,"issue_type":"epic","owner":"4128043+jefffm@users.noreply.github.com","created_at":"2026-01-14T22:08:10.6480093-05:00","created_by":"Jeff Lynn","updated_at":"2026-01-15T09:40:41.6593635-05:00"}
